# Challenge_2 - Loan Qualifier Application
This is a command-line-interface application. It pulls bank loan qualification criteria from a CSV, takes user-inputed information, and filters the bank loans the user would qualify for. It takes as inputs: loan amount, home value, monthly income and customer debt, and returns bank loan information in a .csv file. 

---

## Technologies
This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

> questionary - For interactive user prompts and dialogs

> fire - For the command line interface

---

## Installation Guide
Before running this application first install the following packages:

1. "pip install fire"

2. "pip install questionary"


---

## Usage
### To use the loan qualifier application clone the repository and run the app.py file:

>"python app.py"



**Upon launching the loan qualifier app the user will be greeted with the following prompt:**

!['Enter a file path to a rate-sheet (.csv):'](https://github.com/druchkamgar/Challenge_2_vFinal/blob/78411570c9c7558a68614be9995bda9da26490f6/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-08%20at%2012.58.55%20PM.png)py

Followed by the following questions:

    What's your credit score?

    What's your current amount of monthly debt?

    What's your total monthly income?

    What's your desired loan amount?

    What's your home value?

    Would you like to save your qaulifying loans in a .csv? (Y/n)
    
    Please enter a file path name to save your file

After accurately answering the prompts, the user will have a .csv containing information regarding bank loans they qualify for. They may not qualify for any, in which case the app will exit with the prompt: "You have no qualifying loans". The logic looks as follows:


'''python
 def save_qualifying_loans(qualifying_loans):
    
"""Saves the qualifying loans to a CSV file.

Args:
    qualifying_loans (list of lists): The qualifying bank loans.
"""
if len(qualifying_loans) == 0:
    sys.exit("You have no qualifying loans")
else:
    save_file = questionary.confirm("Would you like to save your qualifying loans in a .csv?").ask()
    if save_file == True:
        csvpath = Path(questionary.text('Please enter a file path name to save your file').ask())
        save_csv(csvpath, qualifying_loans)
    else:
        sys.exit("You chose not to save your qualifying loans.")
